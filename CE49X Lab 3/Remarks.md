Using weather predictions models including Skyrim as Civil or Environmental Engineers has considerable strengths.
The first one that comes the mind are energy related. Weather patterns (be it wind, or precipitation) heavily influence
how dams, hydroelectric plants, or wind based power plants behave, enabling easier predictions of critical infrastructure which society depends upon to function. (Water & Energy). 
However, it also has many hidden benefits, namely on site-work. Increased knowledge of wind and precipitation patterns would greatly influence the workflow plans on construction sites, allowing engineers to fine tune workflows to be safer and more efficient. (i.e: No risky work on heavy winds or rain. / Smarter concrete curing time selection )

This lab provided my first experience in analyzing and manipulating wind speed data. It also served as an introduction to the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which I had not previously encountered. This project was my first opportunity to use Python for data visualization; in the past, I have used tools such as Excel or MATLAB, but I found the Python libraries to be a very effective alternative. I believe the selected visualizations were appropriate for illustrating the key patterns in the data. As this is my first formal data analysis of this nature, I am still developing my ability to draw deeper conclusions from the results.
