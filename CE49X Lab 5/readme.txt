I think I failed to correctly set up my Jupyter as it fails when trying to import.

It should work on your properly-set setup because the code itself works, but either case, I included the raw .py files so you can assess them if there is a mistake.

Also, I had a hard time incorporating the figures into my notebook and do not know if it is just a link to the Picture or if the picture is actually embedded in the notebook.
If the former case is true, you might have problems observing the images.
